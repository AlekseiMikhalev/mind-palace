# Introduction

This is my personal Mind Palace, where I collect knowledge from my learning journey. Every time I read some tech book, documentation, science article, or **"how to"** recipe, I make a summary in the respective section. After I watched a course or project I make a summary too. I took this approach to solve one simple problem - remember what I've read or learnt and be able to apply the knowledge in my life. 

## Mind Palace Structure: 

Mind Palace consist of the following nested categories:

- **Knowledge section** (the widest knowledge group)

    * **Knowledge concept** (category of the group related to the particular technology)

        - **Code snippets** (examples of how to implement the particular knowledge concept)
        Code snippets also include the detailed explanation of each line of code. That helps me to understand
        how the code works and remember it later during the implementation. 

The knowledge base in this digital Mind Palace is related to various software development areas.
My learning path is focused on expanding my knowledge step-by-step and eventually building a
solid base for developing robust complex systems. Therefore, it includes knowledge from frontend 
and backend development, machine learning, data science, databases, software architecture, etc. 

## Couple of words about me
I am a self-taught software developer. I started my programming journey by heart.
In my childhood I wanted to be a programmer. I took some gadgets (whether it was my grandfather's watch
or music player from the town dump), disassemble them and tried to assemble again. I was extremely
interested to understand how they work. But something went wrong and I became a lawyer.
My lawyer career includes eight years in international law firms and venture funds as a corporate lawyer. 
Spending long hours on drafting documents, doing due diligence or revising prospectuses for
capital market deals, I realised that it's not what I want to do for life. It is just not 
my passion. And in my spare time I started to learn programing. Step-by-step I switched into 
software engineering and left my lawyer career behind. That was, and actually still very hard... 

But you know what? I am happy! It gives me energy and meaningful start every day. 
And I won't give up :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

## Comments, recommendation and revisions
I would be happy if you give me any useful comments, recommendation or point out on my mistakes or code errors.
